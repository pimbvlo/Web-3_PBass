            <h3>THE FIRST PRECISION</h3>
            <p>The Precision Bass, first produced in October 1951, is such a special instrument. Because if Clarence Leo Fender were to be remembered for nothing else, surely it would be the Precision—an instrument — indeed a whole new kind of
                instrument — that simply didn’t exist before he invented it, that would forever ensure his place in history. For while all the other great Fender products of the decade certainly affected music, the Precision Bass profoundly affected
                music.</p>
